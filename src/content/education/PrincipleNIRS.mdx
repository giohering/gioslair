Fundamentals of near-infrared spectroscopy

Taking a dive from the broad context we established in the previous chapter, this chapter will ascertain the physical and physiological basis of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements. We will investigate how to extract information from light propagation in biological tissue. To this goal, I will briefly discuss the relevant light-tissue interactions. Then, I will present the hypotheses and solutions for fundamental equations in NIRS applications, and translate the solutions into the desired information from biological tissue. The knowledge and physical intuition gained from this first investigation will be used as context to describe basic instrumentation requirements and options.
