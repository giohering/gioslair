# Greetings visitor!

My name is Giovanni Hering - or “Gio” for short. I am a physicist by training but have spent the last few years helping researchers across the globe with their neuroimaging needs. More specifically, working with near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).

On this website I would love to welcome anyone into my world a little bit. I will post useful fNIRS/neurotech things, but also educational material and the occasional hobby-project.
